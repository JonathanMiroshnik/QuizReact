# QuizReact
React example project of a simple quiz, pulling from public API

(==17.4.25==)
Using the public trivia API: https://opentdb.com
I want to create a quiz game, with an arbitrary number of players, where in each turn, the player must answer a random question.
There is a timer, if the timer runs out, the question ends and the player does not get a point.
If the player answers correctly, he gets a point, and it is added to his total score.


Given a starting number of players N and a number of questions per player M,
At the end of NxM questions, there is a pop-up window that displays the winner and a button for restarting the game.
